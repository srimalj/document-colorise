# document-colorise
These scripts are the answer to a problem I faced when my inkjet printer ran out of black ink but had plenty of color ink left.
The scripts basically colorize a document by converting it from shades of pure black (which required the black ink),
to shades of a given color (which can be printed using the color cartridge).
